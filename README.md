I started out by drawing how I thought the application should run: login - communication with github api>
repos in table, represented by buttons->
click on a button - calls api>
shows all the attributes of the repo

And then deciding on all of the object types that I wanted for the specific actions. The form was text field, 
I would display the repos as buttons in a table, which would link to another view controller,


I wanted to start out with the framework of the app, so the login page, and the actual information
If I finished the framework and ui, first, I could just use the github api and directly use their 
methods to display the info.

currently the files in the repo are just a framework of the app with all the pages that I will
need to display the information.  I need to do the actual business logic with in the app to retrieve
the data.  

I realize after the fact that I was not supposed to make a login page and only a field that accepts 
username and then shows the public repos of the account with that username.
